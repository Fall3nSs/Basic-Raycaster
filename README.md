This project is a basic raycaster implemented using the SDL library. It simulates a 3D perspective by casting rays from the playerâ€™s viewpoint into a 2D grid map. Each ray detects walls by checking for intersections, calculating distances to render vertical slices of walls with correct height, creating a simple 3D effect. This technique is efficient and was popularized by early 3D games like Wolfenstein 3D.
